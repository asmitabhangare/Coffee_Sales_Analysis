# Coffee_Sales_Analysis
 
In this project, I analyzed sales data for a coffee business. The dataset included various details such as transaction ID, transaction date and time, quantity sold, store ID and location, product ID, unit price, product category, product type, and product details.

*Key Features of the Analysis:*

- **Total Sales and Orders:** Calculated the total sales revenue and the number of orders to measure overall business performance.
* **Quantity Sold:** Analyzed the total quantity of coffee products sold.
+ **Daily Sales:** Tracked sales on a daily basis to identify trends and patterns over time.
- **Top 10 Product Sales:** Identified the top 10 best-selling coffee products to understand customer preferences.
* **Sales by Store Location:** Examined sales data by different store locations to identify high-performing and underperforming stores.
+ **Sales by Weekdays and Weekends:** Compared sales performance on weekdays versus weekends to optimize business strategies.
 
This analysis provided valuable insights into the coffee sales performance, helping the business make informed decisions and improve their sales strategies.
